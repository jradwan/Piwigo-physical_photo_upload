# Physical Photo Upload
PPU is a [Piwigo](http://piwigo.org/) extension for uploading photos to an existing physical album.

I don't use the [virtual albums](http://piwigo.org/doc/doku.php?id=user_documentation:albums_management) feature much as I prefer to have all of my photos stored in folders of my own hierarchical design rather than Piwigo's structure used by the upload mechanism (i.e., "./upload/year/month/day/randomfilename.jpg"). Traditionally, this means using FTP or an OS copy to get the photos up on your Piwigo server, followed by a synchronization process.

PPU (Physical Photo Upload) is an attempt to alleviate this inconvenience by allowing you to upload (through a browser) a new photo (or video) to an existing physical album in your gallery, similar to how photos can be added to virtual albums.

## Disclaimer

No program is without bugs and while I've tested the plugin extensively myself, there's always the possibility for something to go wrong. Use simulation mode and check the debugging messages closely before allowing the plugin to make actual changes for the first time. If you find a problem, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/jradwan/Piwigo-physical_photo_upload/issues) on Github or on the [Piwigo forums](http://piwigo.org/forum/) and let me know!
